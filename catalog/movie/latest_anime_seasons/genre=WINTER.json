But 100 years later, they make good on an agreement in hopes of bringing stability to all. The rulers from each land had decided that the Gold Kingdom would offer the most beautiful girl in their kingdom as a bride, to be wed to the most clever man from the Water Kingdom, creating not just a couple but the promise of renewed relations and peace.<br>\n<br>\nWhen it comes time for the rulers to make good on their promise, neither is entirely honest or admirable in their attempts. The Gold Kingdom offers Sara, a kind-hearted, but homely princess while the Water Kingdom marries off Naranbayar, a lanky scholar of modest background. To add insult to injury, the two separately find themselves with a dog (for Sara) and a cat (for Naranbayar) as their partner-to-be. As Sara and Naranbayar individually navigate the palace schemes of their respective homelands, their paths soon converge in a heartwarming new spin on the classic fairytale set-up.<br>\n<br>\n(Source: JAPAN HOUSE Los Angeles)"
